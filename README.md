# FreSpeD

**Frequency specific change point detection (FreSpeD)** is a method proposed by [Schr√∂der & Ombao, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2018.1476238) for detecting change points in EEG signals. By locally estimating spectral density matrices and applying CUSUM statistics, FreSpeD efficiently identifies significant changes in the spectral profile. The method has demonstrated speed and effectiveness in detecting epileptic seizures.

This package was initially published on CRAN in September 2015 and is compatible with R version 3.2.2. However, it has since been archived and is no longer available for versions of R released after 3.2.2. The purpose of this repository is to provide a reimplementation of the original package and introduce new functionalities.
